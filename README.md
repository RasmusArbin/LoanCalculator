# LoanCalculator
The project is a showcase of my other repository, CSharGeneralBackend, that aims to create a general backend foundation for applications. The project simulates a calculation of a monthly payback plan and is developed in Angular, WebApi and a in memory database (this is to show the flexibility of the framework)
